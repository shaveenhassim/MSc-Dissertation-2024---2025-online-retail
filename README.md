## Summary
This repository contains materials, code and the dissertation PDF for the MSc research titled _"Exploring Descriptive and Inferential Statistics using Python for Data-Driven Decision-Making"_. The study applies descriptive and inferential statistical techniques (Shapiro-Wilk, t-test, ANOVA, regression) to the Online Retail dataset to extract business insights on customer behaviour, pricing and purchase patterns.

## Key Analyses and Statistical Test

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removal of missing values, duplicates, and outliers; conversion of data types.
Descriptive Statistics: Central tendency, dispersion, and distribution analysis of key variables (Quantity, UnitPrice).

**Hypothesis Testing:**
-`Shapiro-Wilk Test` — tested normality of sales data.
-`t-Test` — compared mean unit prices between UK and Germany.
-`ANOVA` — examined differences in mean quantities sold across multiple countries.
-`Regression Analysis`: Linear regression to evaluate the relationship between price and quantity sold.

Visualization: Histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and comparative plots to support statistical findings.

## Methodology

-Data Collection & Cleaning — Prepared the Online Retail dataset by filtering invalid records and correcting formats.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Generated descriptive summaries and visualized sales behaviour.
-Inferential Statistics — Applied hypothesis tests and regression to validate patterns and relationships.
-Business Interpretation — Linked statistical outcomes to actionable insights for pricing, inventory, and strategy.

**Insights**

-Non-Normal Distribution: Both quantity and unit price showed skewness, highlighting the importance of using appropriate statistical methods.
-Pricing Consistency: No significant mean price difference between UK and Germany, suggesting standardized pricing across these markets.
-Regional Differences: ANOVA confirmed significant variations in quantities sold between countries, informing localized sales strategies.
-Weak Price-Quantity Correlation: Regression showed only a limited relationship between price and purchase volume, indicating other factors drive demand.
-Business Value: Findings demonstrate how statistical testing supports evidence-based decision-making in e-commerce.
